  notes:
    "Fruit soup is one of the stranger things I decided to make from the books. I decided to go for a cold soup - really more of a fruit salad with juice. I picked fruits that I could trace back to the books, and I'm happy with how it came out.",

    "Peel the ginger and cut into medium sized chunks. Break the cinnamon stick into small pieces. In a saucepan, combine the cinnamon, anise seeds, cloves, ginger, almond extract, and passionfruit juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then remove from heat, cover, and let sit 1 hour.",
    "Strain out the solids and discard. Chill the liquid in the refrigerator until cold, about 2 hours.",
    "Chop the fruits and vegetables to 1/2-3/4 inch cubes: chop the plum, then peel and chop the cucumber, kiwis, and avocado. Toss together with the sugar.",
    "To serve, put some of the fruit mixture in a bowl, then pour the chilled juice over, just enough to not quite cover the fruit."
