  summary: "Deep-fried rice flour flatbread, covered in cinnamon sugar",
  inspiration: "bu√±uelos",
  quantity: "6",
  time: "45 minutes",
  notes:
    'There were a few ways to interpret "flatbread crusted with sugar." I chose to go with rice flour rather than corn because I think the flavor lends itself better to desserts. As for the cooking method, who doesn\'t like deep fried dough covered in sugar?',
  quotes:
    "Tables lined the walkway here, piled with food. Candied meats, stacks of flatbread crusted with sugar, fruits and pastries. (Oathbringer ch 78)",

  steps: [
    "Bring water and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add rice flour all at once and mix until combined.",
    "Remove from heat, cover, and let rest 10 minutes. In the meantime, mix the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.",
    "Knead the cooled dough into a ball. Separate into 6 balls. Heat a deep frier to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "One ball at a time, roll the ball between two sheets of parchment paper until very thin, about 6 inches in diameter. Peel off the paper and place in the deep frier.",
    "Fry 1 minute on the first side until bubbly. Then flip and fry 2-3 minutes more until crispy. It's done when the middle is crisp and doesn't feel soft when you poke it with a fork.",
    "Drain on paper towels for 30 seconds, then sprinkle both sides with a small spoonful of cinnamon sugar."
