  summary:
    "Small flatbread with a pocket, good for chunky curries or the like.",
  inspiration: "Gorditas",
  quantity: "9",
  time: "15 minutes",
  notes:
    "The books don't describe the flatbread that appears other than to say that, you know, it's flat. I didn't want to just use tortillas for everything, so I tried eating one of the curries with gorditas. Filling the pocket with a chunky curry turned out really well.",
  quotes:
    "Sadeasâ€™s... meal still sat on the table, brass plate scattered with chunks of meat and torn flatbread. (The Way of Kings, ch 22)",

    "Combine all ingredients. Mix well. Let sit for 5 minutes - it can take a bit for the masa to absorb the water.",
    "The dough should be pliable, but wet enough to be pinched without cracking. If needed, add additional water to get the right consistency.",
    "Heat an electric nonstick griddle to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Separate dough into 9 sections, and roll them into balls. Place one ball between two sheets of plastic. I like to use a plastic disposable shopping bag that I've cut down the side to open it up flat.",
    "Using a rolling pin or even just a plate, press the dough ball flat until it's 4 inches wide. Place the dough patty on the griddle. Flip once the bottom has formed a crust but hasn't browned yet. Flip again once the bottom has started to brown. At this point it may start to puff just a little bit. Remove once both sides have a few browned spots.",
    "The open along the side, cutting halfway around. Push the knife inside to separate the two sides fully. Scrape out any soft dough remaining inside. Serve with curry."
