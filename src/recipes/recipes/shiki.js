  notes:
    "We know a few things about shiki from Oathbringer chapter 37. It's brownish in color, served chilled, and implied to not be alcoholic. It was unpopular with people not familiar with it, unless they were hot and exhausted. This all sounded to me exactly like mugicha. Mugicha is a Japanese barley tea, known for tasting like 'burnt water.' There's something about it, though, where if you're hot and thirsty, it tastes amazing. The Alethi wouldn't have access to barley, so instead I made something similar with roasted brown rice. Cayenne pepper optionally serves as the lazbo that Huio added.",

    "He stirred the shiki, a brownish Horneater drink that Lunamor had chilled overnight in metal bins (Oathbringer ch 37)",
