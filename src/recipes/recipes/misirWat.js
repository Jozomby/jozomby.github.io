  summary: "Spiced stewed lentils. A Shin spin on an Ethiopian classic.",
  inspiration: "Misir Wat",
  quantity: "4 servings",
  time: "1 hour 40 minutes",
  notes:
    "I have to admit that when I read the words \"misir wat\" in Wind and Truth I didn't recognize that it was a real Ethiopian dish. When I did realize what it was, it changed the way I think about Shin food. What I have here is not the same as real Ethiopian misir wat. I've had to change the recipe to match what the book describes, as the process is described in detail, and not all of the ingredients in a traditional misir wat are available on Roshar. Nevertheless, I think I ended up with a delicious dish.",
  quotes:
    "He left his sister and found his mother beside some improvised firepits, discussing an evening meal to hopefully calm everyone down. Misir wat, a thick paste made of red lentils. (Wind and Truth ch 36)",
