  cuisine: "Alethi Men's Food",
  summary: "Grilled pork and vegetable chunks, served with dipping sauces",
  inspiration: "Shorlog",
  quantity: "10 skewers",
  time: "45 minutes, plus 1-24 hours of marinating",
  notes:
    "This was served at Roshone's manor, who we know clung to old Alethi ways, even when no longer popular. (The Way of Kings ch 25) To try and show that in the meal, I looked to Mongolian dishes and found Shorlog. Shorlog is basically barbecue - meat cooked on skewers over a fire. The legend goes that Mongolian warriors would cook their meat on their shields or with their swords. I could see a similar tradition for the Alethi - semi-nomadic warriors, eating meat on the go. I included vegetables as well since they were mentioned in the text.",
  quotes:
    "...the spicy scents made Kal’s stomach rumble. How long had it been since he’d had pork? There were five different dipping sauces on the table... “Very well,” Roshone said, taking a piece of flatbread from the basket and wrapping it around his skewer, pulling off several vegetable chunks at once and eating them with the bread. (The Way of Kings ch 37)",

Process to a somewhat chunky liquid.",
    "Chop the pork loin into large 2 inch cubes, removing the worst of the fat. Add the pork and the marinade to a ziploc bag, remove as much air as possible, then seal and let sit in the refrigerator for 1 to 24 hours.",
    "1 to 2 hours before cooking the pork, prepare the vegetables. Cut 2 onions and 3 bell peppers in 2 inch chunks, and slice 2 yellow squash into 1/2 inch slices. Add them to the marinade along with the pork. Reseal and let sit in the refrigerator 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Skewer the meat and the vegetables on separate skewers. I prefer metal skewers, but wood/bamboo works as well. If using wood or bamboo, soak the skeweers in water for 15 minutes first. Space the chunks such that they're not quite touching.",
    "Place all skewers on the grill, and grill at about 375 degrees Farenheit for 10 minutes, turning once, or until vegetables are tender and start to blacken on the edges. Remove the vegetable skewers and keep warm. Continue to cook the pork skewers until a meat thermometer registers 145 degrees inside the pork.",

    "Spicy saucee: Dice the onion, and peel and mince thee ginger and garlic. Heat the oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and cook until the onion is transparent but not browned. Add the curry paste and salt. Cook and stir until combined. Add the coconut milk, water, and gochu garu. Cook and stir until combined.",
    "Fruit sauce: Rmove the pit from the plum. Finely chop the plum or process it in a food processor. Peel and mince the ginger. Add both to a saucepan along with the other ingredients. Simmer on medium, covered, stirring occasionally, until everything comes together and forms a sauce.",
