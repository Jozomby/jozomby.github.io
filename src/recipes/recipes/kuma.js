  steps: [
    "Before measuring the tahini, stir it well. It tends to separate in the jar.",
    "In a food processor, combine tahini and lemon juice. Process 30 seconds, then stop and scrape the sides. Process for another 30 seconds.",
    "Add garlic, cumin, coconut oil, salt, paprika, 1 tsp gochu garu, and coriander. Drain the can of hominy, but reserve the liquid. Add the hominy to the other ingredients in the food processor. Process until smooth. Add 1 tbsp of the reserved liquid and process until it forms a spreadable paste. If needed or desired, add additional reserved liquid to make a thinner spread. Garnish with toasted sesame oil, sesame seeds, and 1/4 tsp gochu garu. Serve with flatbread or anything you would eat hummus with."
