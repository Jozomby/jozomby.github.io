  // TODO: make this again with honey to turn it into a women's food dish
  notes:
    "It's fairly normal on earth to eat curry with rice. So I've paired the other curries in this collection with rice. But in the books, they don't always eat curry with tallew (similar to rice). They eat it with lavis (similar to corn) as well. So I decided I needed to try serving a curry with hominy. It ended up working best to cook the hominy into curry. I prepared this neither particularly spicy nor sweet, to help differentiate from the other dishes in the collection. To make a women's food version of this, simply add a tablespoon of honey along with the coconut milk. To make a men's food version, use a spicer curry paste or add a tablespoon or two of gochugaru.",
