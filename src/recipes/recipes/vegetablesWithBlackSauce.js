  notes:
    "This is one of the dishes that Kaladin ate while imprisoned. I decided early on when making these recipes not to use soy sauce. It seems the obvious answer here - salty black sauce. But not using soy sauce felt like a good way to make Rosharan food feel a little more alien. It turns out that there are relatively few other ways to make a truly black sauce, though. I experimented with a few options and like the prune sauce the best. I will not judge you if you just decide to steam the vegetables and top with your favorite soy-based sauce, though (soy sauce, teriyaki, hoisin, etc).",
  quotes:
    "Kaladin sighed, retrieving the food - steamed vegetables, dribbled with a salty black sauce - and flopping back on his bench. (Words of Radiance ch 59)",

  steps: [
    "Peel and grate the ginger. Finely chop the prunes and measure 1/2 cup lightly packed. Add prunes, fish sauce, sesame oil, ginger and 1 cup water to a pot. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.",
    "Peel the onion. Chop the squash, bell peppers, and onion to bite sized pieces. Steam 8 minutes or until vegetables are tender.",
    "Once the prune mixture is done simmering, blend it with an immersion blender until mostly smooth. Add 1/2 tsp salt and enough water (about 1/4 cup) to form a thick yet pourable sauce. Pour sauce over vegetables to serve."
