  notes:
    "Adapting this recipe was fairly straightforward. The biggest question was what liquid and fat to add to the mash to help with texture, since I didn't want to use milk as is normal on earth. Coconut milk worked well for that. It brings a strong flavor to the dish, but I find that it works well with the sweet potatoes.",

    "...some kind of purple Azish vegetable mash, which he ate with his fingers. It tasted so good. Had he ever eaten anything so wonderful? He cried over it. (Rhythm of War ch 113)",
