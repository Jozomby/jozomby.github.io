  quantity: "4 servings",
  time: "1 hour",
  notes:
    "The gravy and rice portion of the recipe was fairly straightforward. The question was the stagm. It's described as a brownish tuber that is small enough for an entire tuber to be a single serving, and it can be sliced into disks that can be picked up and topped with other food. (The Way of Kings ch 54) The closest I could find to this was celeriac (celery root). If your celeriac is too large for a single serving, feel free to use 2 large roots instead of 4 small ones, and to cut them in half once cooked.",
  quotes:
    "His food arrived, steamed stagm—a brownish tuber that grew in deep puddles—atop a bed of boiled tallew. The grain was puffed with water, and the entire meal was drenched in a thick, peppery, brown gravy. (The Way of Kings ch 54)",
