        works well too. I initially tried to lean into the Mongolian roots for
        Alethi food, but I learned that curry is not a part of traditional
        Mongolian cuisine, while it is a staple of Alethi cuisine. Mongolian
        food is also heavy in dairy, which Alethi food is not. Given that, I
        used some Mongolian influences for more traditional Alethi dishes, such
        as the food eaten by Roshone, but looked to India more for the curries
        and spices. I did give a nod to Korea by using gochugaru (Korean red
        pepper flakes) as the way to bring heat to dishes. Being Vorin, Alethkar
        has two cuisines. Food eaten by men is spicy, and women's food is sweet.
        It should be noted that men do eat sweet food as well, such as fruit and
        pastries. (Oathbringer ch 69) But their meals tend toward spicy and
        savory, while women's meals are sweet.

        Azir draws from a number of real world cultures. The skin tones and

        . As for food, the books mention cake, dinner rolls, sausage, mashed
        purple vegetables, and lots of fruit (dried, fresh, jams). I also
        decided to use yeast and wheat flour in some of their dishes, as these
        were things served at the palace, and so more likely to use exotic
        ingredients.

        Kharbranth doesn't have a culture of its own. It's a cosmopolitan city
        that combines peoples from many different cultures. (The Way of Kings ch

        some people there follow Vorin traditions of men's food being spicy and
        women's food being sweet.

        We don't have much information at all about the cultures of the

        they're the closest it gets on Roshar. They have wheat, grapes, chickens, sheep, etc.

            After seeing how careful I was to choose ingredients that fit
            Roshar, you may be surprised to see me recommending using food
            processors and stand mixers. Shouldn't everything be done by hand?
            Shouldn't we chop everything with hand-forged knives, bake in
            wood-fired ovens, cook over a flame, and avoid plastic utensils?
            Well, if you'd like to do that, go for it! If you're familiar with
            those methods, it won't take much tweaking to get these recipes to
            work with them. But for myself, and the common home cook, I've drawn
            the line here. I want these recipes to be doable for most people.
            All the modern methods I suggest are simply ways to make things
            easier. These same things have been done for hundreds if not
            thousands of years, we just have easier ways of doing them now. And
            I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
